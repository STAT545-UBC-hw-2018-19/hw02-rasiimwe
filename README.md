## Data Exploration and Visualization using the [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf) and [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf) R packages


### Overview of assignment and dataset

My [first assignment](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-rasiimwe/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md) on the gapminder dataset comprised of key functions required to explore a dataset before subsequent data analysis. In the first assignment, data exploration was mostly inclined to the aplication of base R and lattice. 

In this assignment I will heavily focus on the application of **dplyr**, an R package for data manipuation and **ggplot2**, an R package for creating elegant data visualizations using the "grammar of graphics". Both are available as [CRAN packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
